Assignment: CSS Hell
====================

Part 1
------

I supplied screenshots of the changes done to these 3 documents:

http://www.gutenberg.org/files/135/135-h/135-h.htm

http://www.gutenberg.org/files/844/844-h/844-h.htm

To apply these CSS changes, open each of the links above, and in your web
developer tool's stylesheet editor, remove ALL Project Gutenberg styles and
paste in the contents of gutenberg.css.

### Project Gutenberg Main Changes:

1. Body
  - Uses an old yellowish patterned background image
  - All text uses Book Antiqua or falls back to a serif font
  - Slight margins on the top and bottom
2. Anchor
  - Hyperlink font color changed to fit color scheme
3. Paragraph
  - Centered box (not the same as centered text)
  - Added 1-line double spacing between paragraphs
  - Constrained to 42em width
4. Headers
  - Centered text
  - Greyish text shadow
5. Images
  - Constrained to 42em width
  - Ridge border
6. Tables
  - Centered box (not the same as centered text)
  - Added background color and padding to make text easier to read
  - Constrained to 42em width

Part 2
------

Simpler than Part 1, just open up good.html and bad.html and revel in their
glory.  Screenshots are also provided in the part2 directory.
