        <p>
          Hi!  I'm Aaron Yong, a Computing Science undergraduate student from the <a href="http://www.ualberta.ca" target="_blank">University of Alberta</a>.
          I will be graduating in May 2014.  I have lived most of my life in Alberta, but am ready to see the world while developing software.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a keen interest in many different areas of computing, most notably games, SaaS and mobile software development.
          I am flexible and am always ready to learn a new language, framework, paradigm, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          I fit well in a team of self-motivated and highly collaborative individuals.  I always strive to promote learning
          and to help others as much as I can.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for stopping by!  Feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:ajyong@ualberta.ca">ajyong@ualberta.ca</a>
          if you would like to chat.
